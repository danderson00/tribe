    <h1>PackScript</h1>
    <h2>Operation</h2>
    <p>
        PackScript is distributed as a Windows console application. A node.js version will be released in
        the near future. PackScript binaries can be obtained from 
        <a href="https://github.com/danderson00/PackScript" target="_blank">github</a> and
        are included in the Tribe <a href="http://danderson00.github.io/Tribe/Tribe.zip">download</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        PackScript.exe has the following command line syntax:
    </p>

    <pre>PackScript.exe ["Directory\To\Process\"] [/watch]</pre>
    
    <p>If no directory is specified, the current working directory is used.</p>
    <p>
        /watch causes PackScript to remain active and keep all output files up to date as files change.
        The console can also be used to interrogate or execute JavaScript members.
    </p>

    <h2>Configuration Files</h2>
    <p>
        PackScript scans recursively through the target directory structure and finds all files 
        fitting the following specifications:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>*pack.config.js</td>
                <td>JavaScript configuration files. These are executed before any other file is processed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>*pack.js</td>
                <td>JavaScript configuration files.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>*.template.*</td>
                <td>These files are loaded as templates and can be accessed by name using the template option.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <p>Create output files by executing the following functions in your configuration files:</p>
    <table class="pointer">
        <tbody data-bind="foreach: Reference.PackScript.functions">
            <tr data-bind="click: Article.show('Reference', 'PackScript/' + name)">
                <td data-bind="text: name"></td>
                <td data-bind="text: description"></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
