    <p>
        The sync function is used to synchronise files from one location to another.
        The following options can be used:
    </p>
    <div data-bind="pane: '/Interface/API/propertyList', data: { properties: Reference.PackScript.sync }"></div>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <pre class="example">
sync({
    to: 'Libraries',
    include: '../../Libraries/foo.js'
});</pre>
    <p>This simple example keeps a local copy of foo.js in sync with an external source.</p>

    <pre class="example">
sync({
    to: 'Build',
    include: [
        'Component1/Build/*.js',
        'Component2/Client/Build/*.js'
    ],
    exclude: 'debug.js',
    recursive: true
});</pre>
    <p>
        Here, we are keeping a master build folder synchronised with individual components.
        The folder structure underneath each included path is preserved.
    </p>
