<h2>Child Flows</h2>
<p>Tribe gives us a neat way of expressing alternate flows.</p>

<div data-bind="pane: '/Interface/sample', data: { name: 'CreditCard/4-Combined', initialFile: 'CreditCardFlow.js', rootPane: 'host', handleNavigation: true }"></div>

<p>
    Our flow now encapsulates the entire navigation flow for the 
    application proces, started in the
    <span class="filename">host</span> pane.
</p>
<p>
    The new
    <span class="filename">startBusiness</span> and
    <span class="filename">startPersonal</span> messages,
    published from the
    <span class="filename">welcome</span> pane,
    trigger alternate child flows within our main flow.
    By default, these child flows will be ended whenever messages
    are handled in the main flow.
</p>

<p>
    We could also have modelled our main navigation flow this way
    and kept our child flows separate by using the
    <span class="filename">start</span> flow helper:
</p>

<div class="example"><span class="str">'startBusiness'</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> flow</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">start</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="typ">BusinessFlow</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> details</span><span class="pun">)</span></div>
