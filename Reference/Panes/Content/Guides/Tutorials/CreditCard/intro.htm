    In this tutorial, we'll show you a simple and elegant way to model your navigation flow and business <br/>
    processes while maximising reuse of your panes. We recommend you have a quick run through the <br/>

    if you haven't already.

<h2>Message Driven Models</h2>
<p>
    Using message or event driven models gives us the ability to decouple our UI components from 
    concerns like navigation and other processes. Components can be expressed as small, autonomous 
    units, making them simpler to test and maintain.
</p>

<p>
    It also gives us an ideal way of managing long running processes, and Tribe provides two mechanisms 
    for this - Sagas and Flows.
</p>

<h2>Sagas</h2>
<p>
    Sagas are roughly based around 
    <a href="http://support.nservicebus.com/customer/portal/articles/860458-sagas-in-nservicebus">NServiceBus sagas</a>
    and provide a mechanism for maintaining state across processes that involve multiple application 
    events or messages.
</p>

<pre class="example">
ShoppingCartSaga = function (saga) {
    var order = { products: [] };
    this.handles = {
        'setCustomer': function (customer) { order.customer = customer; },
        'addProduct': function (product) { order.products.push(product); },
        'addPayment': function (receipt) { 
            order.paymentReceipt = receipt;
            saga.pubsub.publish('despatchOrder', order);
            saga.end();
        },
    };
};</pre>

<p>
    Tribe also gives us the unique ability to seamlessly distribute messages across clients, allowing
    synchronisation of these Sagas across multiple clients, both web and mobile.
</p>

<p>
    Flows are special versions of sagas that attach to the closest navigation node in your application 
    and provide an additional API for modelling navigation flows.
