    In this tutorial, we'll show you a simple and elegant way to model your navigation flow and business <br/>
    processes while maximising reuse of your panes.

<p>
    We recommend you have a quick run through the

    if you haven't already.

<p>To demonstrate, we're going to build a simple UI for handling credit card applications. Let's have a crack at creating something for personal customers.</p>

<div data-bind="pane: '/Interface/sample', data: { name: 'CreditCard/1-Personal', initialFile: 'welcome.js', rootPane: 'welcome', handleNavigation: true }"></div>

<p>
    Seems like a reasonable start. Build up an object with the application details and pass it to our confirmation pane.
</p>
<p>
    Let's look at adding an alternate flow for business customers. We'd really like to reuse that contact pane, but
    the navigate call takes us to a pane that doesn't collect the data we need for business customers.

<p>
    Passing an object around and adding properties to it makes me a little uneasy too.
    How do we know we're not overwriting an existing property?
