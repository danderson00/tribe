        Tribe allows you to easily break your UI down into "panes" that can consist 
        of a JavaScript model, HTML template and CSS stylesheet. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Simply create these files and refer to the pane by name. No complex configuration required.
    </p>

    <div data-bind="pane: '/Interface/sample', data: { name: 'About/Tasks', initialFile: 'layout.htm' }"></div>

        This is pretty trivial example. You can check out the <a href="" target="_blank">source</a> 
        to this site or the <a href="" target="_blank">samples</a>.

        If you're using Chrome, head over to the <a href="debug.html">debug version</a> of the site 
        and look at the source in the developer tools.
