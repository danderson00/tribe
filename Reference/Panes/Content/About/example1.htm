        Tribe allows you to easily break your UI down into "panes" that can consist 
        of a JavaScript model, HTML template and CSS stylesheet. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Simply create these files and refer to the pane by name. No complex configuration is required.
    </p>

    <div data-bind="pane: '/Interface/sample', data: { name: 'About/Tasks', initialFile: 'layout.htm' }"></div>

        Tribe gives you an awesome debugging experience. Using the developer tools built in to Google Chrome, 
        your file structure is preserved and each individual JavaScript file is fully debuggable.

    <p>
        To see this in action, head over to the <a href="debug.html">debug version</a> of the site using
        Chrome and check out the "Sources" tab in the developer tools.
