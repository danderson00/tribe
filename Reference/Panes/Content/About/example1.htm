        Tribe allows you to easily break your UI down into "panes" 
        and communicate between these panes using a publish / subscribe message bus.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each pane can consist of a JavaScript model, a HTML template and CSS stylesheet. 
        Simply create these files and refer to the pane by name. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Tribe does the rest - loads
        the resources, renders the template and binds an instance of the model to it.
    </p>

    <div data-bind="pane: '/Interface/sample', data: { name: 'Tasks', initialFile: 'layout.htm' }"></div>

        This is, of course, pretty trivial. Check out the samples or the source to
